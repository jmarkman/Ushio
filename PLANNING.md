# UshioBot

## Core Concept

UshioBot is my personal bot that I'll add features to as I see fit.

"lol nice anime bot IDIOT"

Ushio the real-life ship was a destroyer that performed a lot of "helper" functions such as towing, escort and defense, supply and troop transport, and rescue operations. Ushio the Kantai Collection shipgirl is modeled after this.

The shipgirls can also be modified with various parts to alter their stats, much like adding and removing bot components. There's also lots of fanart so the bot can cycle through avatars.

## Current Features I Have

- "Regionalify" command (might be broken now that regional character pairings turn into flags correctly)
- Pokedex (need to make some various search changes to handle alolan pkmn and add rate limiting)

## Features I'd Like

- Clip Service (get either Twitch clip or server-hosted clip and send as link to Discord, allowing Discord to embed it)
- Street Fighter 5 Frame Data (Yaksha bot has crappy move name inference and poor data organization)
